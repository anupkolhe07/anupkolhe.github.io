## Projects

### Fraudulent Transactions Detection

- Developed a fraud detection model utilizing transaction details, device information, and user characteristics.
- Overcame data imbalance using SMOTEEN, managed high categorical feature count through target mean encoding, and prevented overfitting via hyperparameter tuning.
- Compared to various ML models, XGBoost outperformed others with a Recall of 0.94 and F1 scores of 0.92 for both training and testing.

### Consignment Price Predictions

- Developed a forecast consignment pricing model incorporating Vendor INCO Terms, Shipment Mode, Insurance, and product characteristics.
- Implemented robust data preprocessing techniques including missing data handling, log transformations, and outlier treatment.
- Achieved high predictive accuracy using Random Forest Regressor with R-square values of 0.97 on training and 0.96 on testing data, along with an RMSE score of 0.4 on both sets.
